# vGrant Contract

This project implements a decentralized grant and bounty system leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify GitHub activity. It allows users to create bounties for GitHub issues and rewards assignees upon verified issue closure.

## Overview

The system uses ZKPs to:
1.  **Verify GitHub Account Ownership:** Ensure that a user claiming a bounty is the legitimate owner of the linked GitHub account.
2.  **Verify Issue Closure:** Confirm that a specific GitHub issue has been closed by the assignee.

This allows for a trustless and automated way to manage and distribute bounties for open-source contributions.

## Contracts

The core logic is handled by the following smart contracts:

*   **`token.sol`**: An ERC20 token used for funding and distributing bounties.
*   **`src/VgrantGithubProver.sol`**: This contract is responsible for generating the ZK proof. It likely interacts with an off-chain service that fetches data from the GitHub API and constructs the proof attesting to GitHub account ownership or issue status.
*   **`src/VgrantVerifier.sol`**: This contract verifies the ZK proofs generated by the `VgrantGithubProver.sol`. It contains the logic to:
    *   Verify a user's GitHub account.
    *   Allow users to create and fund bounties for specific GitHub issues.
    *   Allow assignees to claim bounties after an issue is verified as closed via a ZK proof.
    *   Distribute the `token.sol` funds to the rightful bounty claimant.

## Workflow

1.  **User GitHub Verification:**
    *   A user initiates a GitHub account verification process.
    *   The `VgrantGithubProver.sol` (or an associated off-chain component) fetches relevant data from GitHub and generates a ZK proof of account ownership.
    *   The user submits this proof to the `VgrantVerifier.sol` to link their Ethereum address to their GitHub identity.

2.  **Bounty Creation:**
    *   Any user (the "sponsor") can create a bounty for a specific GitHub issue by calling a function on `VgrantVerifier.sol`.
    *   The sponsor specifies the GitHub issue URL and locks up a certain amount of `token.sol` as the bounty.

3.  **Issue Resolution & Bounty Claim:**
    *   A GitHub user (the "assignee") resolves the issue.
    *   The `VgrantGithubProver.sol` (or an associated off-chain component) generates a ZK proof confirming the issue is closed and was assigned to the claimant.
    *   The assignee, whose GitHub account is already verified and linked to their Ethereum address, submits this proof to the `VgrantVerifier.sol`.
    *   If the proof is valid, the `VgrantVerifier.sol` transfers the bounty (`token.sol`) to the assignee.

## For Hackathon Partners

*   **Integration Points:**
    *   Frontend applications can interact with `VgrantVerifier.sol` to display available bounties, allow users to create new bounties, and facilitate the claim process.
    *   Bots or other services could use these contracts to automate bounty creation for specific repositories or issue types.
*   **Key Functions to Look At (in `VgrantVerifier.sol` - *likely names, please verify*):**
    *   `verifyGitHubAccount(bytes memory proof, ...)`: For users to prove their GitHub identity.
    *   `createBounty(string memory issueUrl, uint256 amount, ...)`: For sponsors to create bounties.
    *   `claimBounty(string memory issueUrl, bytes memory proof, ...)`: For assignees to claim bounties.
    *   `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)` (on `token.sol`): Sponsors will need to approve the `VgrantVerifier.sol` contract to spend their tokens for bounty creation.
